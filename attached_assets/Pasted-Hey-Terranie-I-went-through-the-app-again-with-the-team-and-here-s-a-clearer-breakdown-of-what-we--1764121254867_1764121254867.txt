Hey Terranie,
I went through the app again with the team, and here’s a clearer breakdown of what we've done

Scope here

1. We reviewed the entire latest Replit build

We pulled up the most recent version of the Replit app and checked:

What UI actually exists

What is reusable as-is

What still needs backend logic

What needs both UI and backend

Which flows need context-based or secure handling

For every feature, we added notes on whether the UI exists on Replit (“true/false”) and whether reuse was possible.

This ensures we’re not estimating blindly — we mapped everything line-by-line.

2. AI module (Nia): Reusable UI, but backend still needs full implementation

The AI module is the most advanced part of the current build, and the UI exists, which helps.

But what isn’t built yet is:

backend workflows

security checks

context awareness logic (e.g., pregnancy stage–specific responses)

data validation

error handling

integration with the rest of the app

So we reused whatever UI we could but still had to allocate hours for the backend foundation that makes the feature safe and reliable.

3. Notifications: UI does not exist

The notification system (push, monthly check-ins, red flags) isn’t in Replit at all.

So this part includes:

building the UI

setting up backend logic

scheduling

validations

QA and safety checks

We’ve separated this into two groups to keep things lean and phaseable.

4. Admin portal + budget model

These are essential for you to manage the app, but none of this exists in Replit.

So this is a fresh build — and we kept it as slim as possible.

5. Village / community features

We included these hours separately since they’re clearly phaseable.

No UI exists for these, so these can easily be moved to a later stage.

6. We removed the entire design system to reduce hours

Because the current visual direction is good enough for V1, we removed:

design system

new components

extra design cycles

We are reusing the Replit design wherever possible to save time.

7. What can be reused

From the Replit build, here’s what’s actually helping reduce hours:

screens where the UI is fully present

the visual direction (removes design hours)

certain layouts

early versions of the Nia UI

What cannot be reused is:

missing UI (quite a few areas)

backend logic (almost all of it)

security checks

notification engine

admin portal

any context-aware AI workflows
