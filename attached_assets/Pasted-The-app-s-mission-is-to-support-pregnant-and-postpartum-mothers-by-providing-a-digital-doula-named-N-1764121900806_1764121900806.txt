The app’s mission is to support pregnant and postpartum mothers by providing a digital doula named Nia, daily check‑ins, personalized insights, and a community of resources. Below you will find the key features grouped by user flow and functionality.
1. Onboarding & Account Setup
When first launching the app, moms are greeted by Nia with a brief welcome message and are offered two options: Create Account or Log In.
During account creation, ask for:
Name and basic contact information.
City or zip code for geolocation so we can personalize resources.
Current pregnancy stage (e.g., trimester) or if postpartum.
Due date or baby’s birth date.
Pregnancy and birth related questions
Agreement to terms and conditions.
Use this information to tailor content and match users with appropriate resources.
2. Provider & Doula Information
Collect the user’s obstetrician, midwife or primary provider’s name and email address.
If the user only knows the provider’s name, allow them to enter it and search our database to verify and retrieve email details.
Allow moms to add a doula’s name and email so the app can keep them informed.
Store this care team info so that notifications can be sent when red flags arise or when monthly summaries are ready.
3. Partner Invitation & View‑Only Portal
During onboarding, give moms the option to Invite Partner.
Generate a unique code that partners can use to create their own account.
Partners have a view‑only version of the app:
They can see daily check‑in results and baby insights.
They cannot edit any of the mom’s data or settings.


Partners receive notifications when daily check‑ins are completed and if any concerns surface.
4. Daily Experience (Affirmations & Check‑Ins Page)
Each day moms receive a pop‑up notification and reminder to check in with an Affirmation that changes daily. These messages should feel supportive and positive.
Upon opening the app, immediately after the affirmation, display three consistent check‑in questions:
Feelings: How are you feeling today?
Self‑care: Are you caring for your body?
Support: Do you feel supported right now?
Answers are logged and used to generate trend insights. Partners see the results; providers/doulas only see alerts (see notifications below).
5. Notifications & Reporting
Providers and doulas should not receive daily check‑in emails; instead:
Red flag alerts: If a mom’s responses indicate negative feelings, lack of support, or potential risk, automatically send an alert email to the care team (provider and doula) and a notification to the partner.
Monthly summaries: Send a summary email once per month to providers and doulas highlighting overall trends (e.g., mood stability, engagement levels) only when there are no red flags.
Partners receive real‑time notifications when check‑ins are completed and when red flags are detected.
6. Baby & Postpartum Development Page
The Baby page shows developmental updates:
If the user is pregnant, display weekly fetal development information.
If postpartum, show baby milestones appropriate for the infant’s age.
Include quick links for critical information:
Red flags: Link to trusted resources (e.g., CDC pages) detailing signs and symptoms to watch for.
Activities: Suggest appropriate activities (e.g., tummy time) for postpartum moms and babies.
7. Engagement & Insights Dashboard Page
Provide a main Insights screen summarizing the user’s journey:
Engagement tracker: Shows how frequently mom engages with the app. Incentivize high engagement.
Mood trends: Visualize trends from daily check‑in responses over time.
Baby progress: Summarize developmental progress relative to gestational age or postpartum milestones.
Care team list: Display the selected provider, doula, and partner.
Appointments: Allow moms to view all upcoming appointments in one list for convenience.
8. Appointments Page: 
Allow moms to either manually add upcoming appointments related to pregnancy/postpartum or sync them from Google Calendar (via Gmail). All events should appear in one list for convenience.
9. Village Page (Community & Resources)
Build a Village page that acts as a resource hub. Based on the user’s zip code, populate:
Mom support groups.
Healthcare providers and clinics.
Breastfeeding support networks and peer groups.
Doula networks.
Advocacy and legal support organizations.
Users can browse and select resources; selected resources should be saved and displayed in a “My Resources” list.
10. Chat with Nia (AI Digital Doula)
Integrate a conversational interface where moms can chat with Nia for questions, guidance or emotional support.
The chat must monitor for concerning statements; if anything indicates distress or a potential emergency, trigger the same red‑flag notification process (email to provider/doula and partner notification).
Preserve conversation history for the mom to review; ensure privacy and confidentiality.
11. Additional Considerations
Privacy & Security: Protect all personal data under applicable privacy laws (e.g., HIPAA). Use encryption and secure storage for sensitive information.
Accessibility: Ensure the app is intuitive, with readable fonts and clear navigation.
Scalability: Design the architecture so that future resources or features (e.g., mental health specialists, community forums) can be added easily.
12. Business Model, Pricing & Budget
Alongside the functional requirements, it’s important for the development team to understand the pricing strategy and budget constraints for the first phase of the project.
Pricing Tiers
The Heart Next Door app is designed to be accessible and heart‑centered. Since moms will not directly fund the platform, the pricing stays intentionally low. The proposed tiers are:
Free – Care‑Provider Sponsored: Their access is paid for by care providers.
$9.99/month – Nurture Monthly: Subscription tier for moms who choose monthly billing.
$79/year – Nurture Annual: Annual subscription.
$99 Lifetime – Founding Mama: One‑time payment for lifetime acces
