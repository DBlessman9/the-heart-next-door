5. HIPAA & Sensitive Information

The Heart Next Door App is not a covered entity under HIPAA, but we voluntarily uphold its spirit.
If we partner with licensed providers who fall under HIPAA, their use of your data will follow HIPAA regulations.
We do not store or transmit medical records or diagnostic data without your explicit consent.
